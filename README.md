# Naive-Bayes-Classifier
Introduction

The Naive-Bayes classifier is a popular machine learning algorithm for classification tasks. It is particularly well-suited for text classification problems such as spam detection, sentiment analysis, and document categorization. This repository provides an easy-to-use implementation of the Naive-Bayes classifier, along with examples demonstrating its usage.
Installation

To use this implementation, you will need Python 3 and a few additional packages. You can install the required packages using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
To use the Naive-Bayes classifier, you need to prepare your data and train the model. Here is a simple example:
from naive_bayes import NaiveBayesClassifier
In python
# Example data
data = [
    ("I love this movie", "positive"),
    ("This is an amazing film", "positive"),
    ("I hated this movie", "negative"),
    ("This film was terrible", "negative"),
]

# Create and train the classifier
classifier = NaiveBayesClassifier()
classifier.train(data)

# Classify a new instance
result = classifier.classify("I love this film")
print(result)  # Output: positive
Examples

You can find more examples of how to use the Naive-Bayes classifier in the examples directory. These examples cover various use cases and demonstrate different features of the classifier.
